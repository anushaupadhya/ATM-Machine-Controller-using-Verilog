# ATM-Machine-Controller-using-Verilog
This work is the development and implementation of a Moore machine state diagram of an ATM controller. The developed design is modeled using Verilog HDL language.The verification of developed model is made by identifying the suitable test cases in a test bench. The simulation is carried out using Modelsim tool and the intended functionality is verified with the help of its simulation results and also it can be synthesized using the Xilinx tool.
